    "Q1. What is a random variable in probability theory ?\n",
    "   > A random variable is a variable whose values are determined by the outcomes of a random phenomenon. It can be thought of as a function that assigns numerical values to outcomes in a sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the types of random variables?\n",
    ">  There are two main types:\n",
    "    1 Discrete Random Variables – Take countable values (e.g., 0, 1, 2...).\n",
    "    2 Continuous Random Variables – Take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
    ">     Discrete distributions describe the probability of discrete outcomes.\n",
    "     Continuous distributions describe probabilities over intervals using a density function, and the probability of a single exact value is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
    ">    For continuous variables, the Probability Density Function (PDF) describes the relative likelihood of a value occurring in a range.\n",
    "     The area under the PDF curve within a range gives the probability of the variable falling in that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
    ">    PDF shows likelihood per value (or range).  \n",
    "    CDF shows cumulative probability up to a value.\n",
    "    CDF(x) = P(X ≤ x)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
    ">    A distribution where all outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "    Example: Rolling a fair die (P(1) = P(2) = ... = P(6) = 1/6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
    ">   Two outcomes: Success (1) and Failure (0)\n",
    "    One trial\n",
    "    Parameter: p (probability of success)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n",
    ">   Models the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials\n",
    "    Parameters: n (trials), p (probability of success)\n",
    "    Used in quality control, medical testing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9.  What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
    ">    Models the number of events in a fixed interval of time/space given a constant average rate (λ)\n",
    "    Used for rare event counts: number of emails per hour, accidents per day\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
    ">    Every value in an interval [a, b] is equally likely\n",
    "    PDF = 1 / (b − a)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",
    ">    Symmetrical, bell-shaped curve\n",
    "    Mean = Median = Mode\n",
    "    Defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",
    ">   A normal distribution with mean = 0 and SD = 1\n",
    "    Used for standardizing values (Z-scores) and looking up probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n",
    ">   The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population’s distribution.\n",
    "    It allows us to use normal distribution-based methods in hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
    " >   The CLT explains why many statistics follow a normal distribution and justifies using Z-scores and confidence intervals in real-world data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
    " >   Used to determine if a sample mean is significantly different from a population mean.\n",
    "    Helps in rejecting or accepting a null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n",
    " >   Z = (X-μ) / σ\n",
    "    Measures how many standard deviations a value (X) is from the mean (μ)\n",
    "    Useful for comparing data from different distributions\n"
