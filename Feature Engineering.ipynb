    "Q1  What is a parameter?\n",
    " -  A parameter in ML is an internal variable that the model learns from the training data, such as weights and biases in a neural network or coefficients in linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is correlation?\n",
    "-  Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two variables move in relation to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
    " - A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. The correlation coefficient (r) lies between -1 and 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",

    "\n",
    "5. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
    "The loss value quantifies how far the model’s predictions are from actual values. A lower loss indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
    " - Continuous variables: Numerical values with infinite possibilities (e.g., height, weight).\n",
    "   Categorical variables: Represent categories or labels (e.g., gender, color).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How do we handle categorical variables in ML? What are common techniques?\n",
    "Common techniques:\n",

    " Encoding categorical features\n",
    " Normalization and transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is a Test set?\n",
    " - A test set is a separate portion of data used only to evaluate the model's performance after training.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
    " - from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",

    " Evaluate and improve the model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
    " - EDA helps understand the data distribution, detect anomalies, find patterns, and make informed decisions about preprocessing and model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is correlation? \n",
    "-  Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two variables move in relation to each other.\n",

    "   data.corr()\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is causation? Explain the difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
    " - Causation means one variable directly affects the other. Correlation just shows a relationship but doesn’t imply cause.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "  Correlation: Ice cream sales ↑ → Drowning ↑ (due to hot weather).\n",
    "   Causation: Smoking causes lung cancer.\n",
